## Introduction

Used laptops often comes to small repairing shops, or servicing centers, they pick the working laptops,
even repairable laptops just gets in to e-waste. Actual makers don't promote the reusability of a laptop,

Many companies replace their employees working laptops, the old ones taken
down as e-waste, no one makes such interests in selling them because the market for used laptops
is low.\
As COVID 19 changes many things, one of main thing is the education sector, In the forthcoming years, education going to get more digital, any teacher can do classes from any where, and there is already that information explosion happening,

But in a developing country like india, not every young minds got a chance to get a brand new laptop for
their learning, as even a running 10 year old laptop can be good at usual browsing, online classes and coding, a lot more people get benefitted. Usedbrains is made from that point of view to make that right connection happen,

This project is developed as a bridge between those sellers and those people who now can't afford
a new laptop or just need a secondary basic one.

Also,

As computers are customizable,

* A hard-drive missing computer can be benefitted to one who got a portable hard-drive,
* A display broken one can be benefitted to one who got an old monitor lying around,
* A lap with keyboard complaint can be benefitted to a user who does not needs portability, and aiming to use with an external keyboard
* A lap with no battery can be used as plugged in, as a local server etc.. as a

As so and so many hacks and use cases lying around, just getting of that old lap as e waste, is not a very smart idea anytime..

As any good component is worth for someone.

In Usedbrains, buyers can contact to seller inquire about the working conditions and whereabouts of laptop, find their best buy,\
Authentic sellers can pick the good laptops repair the minor damages, replace the hard-drives, or hard resets the hard drive (data-security) and sells through Usedbrains that can help some one somewhere go digital, get more productive, reuse components keeping earth green, and so many other endless benefits and possibilities.

So, reduce e-waste, Pick what you need, bring up a smile :).
